     * LeetCode 198 â€” House Robber
     *
     * You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.
     * Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, but adjacent houses
     * have security systems connected, so you cannot rob two adjacent houses.
     *
     * Return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the
     * police.
     *
     * Example:
     * Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
     * Output: 12
     * Explanation: Rob house 1 (2), house 3 (9), and house 5 (1) => 2 + 9 + 1 = 12
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(n)
     * Space Complexity: O(1)
