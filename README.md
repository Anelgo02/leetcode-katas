## 🔎 What’s Inside

* Idiomatic code with concise, **why-focused** comments.
* Problems grouped by topic (arrays, two-pointers, graphs/BFS–DFS, …).
* Occasionally, alternative approaches (e.g., compact-good vs swap-with-tail).

## 🧭 Conventions

* Each file starts with a short header.
* Comments explain **reasoning** over mechanics; obvious lines are not commented.
* No external dependencies; in-place and linear-time solutions when feasible.
